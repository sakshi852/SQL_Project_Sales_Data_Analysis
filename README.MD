## Sales and Profit Analysis
<a name="sales-and-profit-analysis"></a> 


1. **Analyzing the year wise total sales and profit**

```sql

with summary as (
select 
    extract (year from order_date) as year, 
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit
from superstore
group by year
order by year asc
)
select *, 
     cast (((total_sales * 1 / lag(total_sales) over (order by year)) - 1) * 100 as decimal (10,1)) as sales_increase,
     cast (((total_profit * 1 / lag(total_profit) over (order by year)) - 1) * 100 as decimal (10,1)) as profit_increase
from summary;
```

![Total Sales and Profit](image-6.png)

####  üìä Key Insights:

- The year-wise sales and profit data reveals a steady upward trend overall, with a slight dip in sales in 2015. Despite this, profit still grew in 2015, suggesting effective cost management. 
- Significant growth in both sales (29.5%) and profit (32.7%) in 2016 indicates a year of strong performance, likely driven by strategic decisions or market conditions. 
-  The momentum continued in 2017 with both sales and profits increasing, although at a slower pace compared to 2016. Optimizing strategies during periods of slower growth could help sustain long-term profitability and sales increases.

<br/>

 2. **Analyzing Quarter wise total sales and profit**

```sql
with summary as (

from superstore
group by quarter
order by quarter asc
)
select *, 
     cast (((total_sales * 1 / lag(total_sales) over (order by quarter)) - 1) * 100 as decimal (10,1)) as sales_increase,
     cast (((total_profit * 1 / lag(total_profit) over (order by quarter)) - 1) * 100 as decimal (10,1)) as profit_increase
from summary;
```

![Quarter wise Sales and Profit](image-7.png)


####  üìä Key Insights:

The data reveals a consistent increase in sales and profit throughout the quarters, with Q4 showing the highest performance. Sales surged by 43% and profits by 52.7% in Q4, which suggests strong seasonal effects or effective end-of-year strategies. Q3 also demonstrated significant growth, indicating a robust period, while Q1 lagged behind with the lowest figures.
 
  To optimize sales performance year-round, consider enhancing Q1 results through targeted promotions or introducing new products early in the year to build momentum.

<br/>

3. **Analyzing segment wise total sales and profit**

```sql
select 
    segment, 
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit,
    cast((sum(Profit)/sum(Sales)) *100 as decimal(10,0)) AS profit_margin_percentage
from superstore
group by segment
order by total_sales;
```

![Segment wise Sales and Profit](image-8.png)

####  üìä Key Insights:

The Consumer segment leads with the highest sales and profit, despite having the lowest profit margin of 12%. The Corporate segment shows strong sales and a decent profit margin of 13%, while the Home Office segment, though having the smallest sales, exhibits a slightly higher profit margin of 14%. 

To boost overall profitability, consider strategies to enhance the profit margins in the Consumer segment and leverage the higher margin in the Home Office segment for growth.

<br/>

4. **Analyzing region wise total sales and profit**

```sql
select 
    region, 
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit
from superstore
group by region
order by total_sales desc;
```

![Region wise Sales and Profit](image-3.png)

####  üìä Key Insights:

Top-Performing Regions: The West region outperforms others with the highest total sales and profit, indicating a strong market presence and potentially effective sales strategies. The East region also shows robust performance, though it lags behind the West. The Central and South regions have lower sales and profit, with the South showing the lowest figures

Opportunity for Expansion: Focus on enhancing market strategies in the Central and South regions. Leveraging successful tactics from the top-performing West region could help increase sales and profitability in these areas.

<br/>

5. **Analyzing category wise total sales and profit**


```sql
select 
    category, 
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit,
    cast((sum(Profit)/sum(Sales)) *100 as decimal(10,0)) AS profit_margin_percentage
from superstore
group by category
order by total_sales desc;
```

![Category wise Sales and Profit](image-9.png)

####  üìä Key Insights:

The data reveals that the Technology and Office Supplies categories are the most profitable, each achieving high profit margins, with Technology standing out for its exceptional performance. 

In contrast, the Furniture category, despite generating substantial sales, has a significantly lower profit margin. This suggests a need for strategic improvements in pricing or cost management within the Furniture category to enhance overall profitability.

<br/>

6. **Analyzing sub-category wise total sales and profit**

```sql
select 
    sub_category, 
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit,
    cast((sum(Profit)/sum(Sales)) *100 as decimal(10,0)) AS profit_margin_percentage
from superstore
group by Sub_category
order by profit_margin_percentage desc;
```

![Sub Category wise Sales and Profit](image-10.png)
![Profit Margin](image-5.png)


####  üìä Key Insights:

The sub-category analysis shows significant variation in profitability. Labels, Paper, and Envelopes are the top performers with high profit margins, indicating strong profitability and efficient cost management. 

On the other hand, Supplies, Bookcases, and Tables are struggling with negative profit margins, suggesting issues with either pricing or cost structure.Addressing these issues, possibly through price adjustments or cost reductions, could improve profitability in these less successful sub-categories. Additionally, focusing on leveraging the high-margin sub-categories could help boost overall profit margins.

</br>

## Product Performance
<a name="product-performance"></a> 


1. **Determining the Best-Selling Products**

```sql
select product_name,
    cast (sum(quantity) as decimal (10,1)) as quantity_sold,
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit
from superstore
group by product_name
order by quantity_sold desc;
```

####  üìä Key Insights:

The analysis reveals that products like "Easy-staple paper" and "Staple envelope" have high sales and profits, indicating strong market demand. However, products such as "KI Adjustable-Height Table" have high sales but negative profit margins, suggesting pricing or cost issues.  Additionally, Products such as "Xerox 1984" and "Grip Seal Envelopes" have very low sales volumes, suggesting limited market appeal or niche usage.

<br/>

2. **Analysing the least profit margin products**

```sql
select product_name,
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit,
    cast((sum(Profit)/sum(Sales)) *100 as decimal(10,0)) AS profit_margin_percentage
from superstore
group by product_name
order by profit_margin_percentage asc
limit 20;
```
![Least profit margin products](image-11.png)

####  üìä Key Insights:

Several products, such as the "Eureka Disposable Bags" and "Bush Westfield Collection Bookcases," are experiencing extremely negative profit margins, leading to substantial financial losses. Items like the "Euro Pro Shark Stick Mini Vacuum" and "Zebra GK420t Printer" also reflect consistently poor profitability, suggesting ongoing issues with these products. 

To address these challenges, it‚Äôs crucial to re-evaluate pricing strategies, reduce production or procurement costs, and explore potential improvements in product quality. In some cases, discontinuing these unprofitable items might be a necessary step to prevent further losses.

<br/>

3. **Identifying low performing products**

```sql
select product_name,
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit
from superstore
group by product_name
having 
    sum(sales) < 100
    and sum(profit)<100
order by total_profit asc
limit 10;
```

![Low Performing Products](image-12.png)

####  üìä Key Insights:

The data highlights a critical issue with several products that are underperforming, showing both low sales and negative profits. They are not only failing to generate adequate revenue but are also contributing to losses. Immediate action is needed to address these products to prevent further financial losses. Strategies should include reassessing pricing strategies, improving product quality or features, and ramping up marketing efforts. 

Additionally, conducting market research and gathering customer feedback will be crucial to understand the root causes of these issues and to devise effective solutions.

</br>

## Discount Impact
<a name="discount-impact"></a> 


1. **Analyzing Discount Impact on Sales and Profitability**

```sql
select 
    discount,
    sum((sales/(1-discount))-sales) as sum_discount,
    cast (sum(quantity) as decimal (10,1)) as quantity_sold,
    cast(avg(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as avg_sales, 
    cast(sum(sales) as decimal(10,1)) as total_sales, 
    cast (sum(profit) as decimal (10,1)) as total_profit,
    cast((sum(Profit)/sum(Sales)) *100 as decimal(10,0)) AS profit_margin_percentage
from superstore
group by discount
order by discount desc
```
![Discount Analysis](image-13.png)

####  üìä Key Insights:

- High Discounts and Losses: Discounts of 0.8 to 0.6 drive large sales volumes but lead to severe losses, with profit margins ranging from -180% to -89%. These deep discounts are unsustainable and heavily erode profitability, indicating the need to reassess their effectiveness.
- Moderate Discounts and Balanced Margins: Discounts from 0.5 to 0.3 offer a better balance between sales and profitability. While profit margins remain negative, the losses are less extreme, suggesting this range could be optimized for better results.
- Low Discounts and Profitability: Discounts of 0.2 and below yield positive profit margins (12%-17%), proving more sustainable. These discounts attract fewer sales but generate higher profits, offering a strategic approach to retaining customers while boosting profitability.

A tiered discount strategy, using lower discounts for profitability and higher ones selectively, can balance volume and profit while maintaining customer satisfaction.

<br/>

2. **Discount analysis broken down by quarter,region and category**

```sql
select 
    extract(quarter from order_date) as quarter,
    cast(avg(discount) as decimal (10,1)) as avg_discount,
    cast(sum((sales/(1-discount))-sales) as decimal (10,1)) as sum_discount_value,
    cast(sum(quantity) as decimal (10,1)) as quantity_sold,
    cast((sum(Profit)/sum(Sales)) *100 as decimal(10,0)) AS profit_margin_percentage
from superstore
group by quarter
order by quarter asc
```

# Conclusion


***Sales and Profit Analysis***

* Yearly and Quarterly Trends: Sales and profits have shown steady growth overall, with notable peaks in Q4 and significant annual increases from 2014 to 2017. However, growth rates varied, with Q4 and the final year showing the highest performance. Emphasizing Q1 improvements and managing seasonal fluctuations could balance sales more evenly throughout the year.

* Segment and Regional Performance: The Consumer segment and the West region lead in total sales and profit, while the South segment and Central region lag behind. Strategies to boost performance in underperforming segments and regions could enhance overall profitability.

* Category and Sub-Category Insights: Technology and Office Supplies categories exhibit strong profit margins, whereas Furniture lags significantly. Within sub-categories, items like Labels and Paper are highly profitable, while Supplies and Bookcases are not. Focusing on high-margin products and addressing issues in underperforming sub-categories could improve profitability.

Overall, the analysis indicates a robust growth trajectory with specific areas needing targeted strategies to optimize performance and balance profitability.

</br>

***Product performance analysis***

* High Performers: Products such as "Easy-staple paper" and "Staple envelope" show high sales and profits, reflecting strong market demand. These successful products should be the focus of inventory and marketing optimization strategies.

* Low Profit Margins: Items like "KI Adjustable-Height Table" and "Epson TM-T88V Direct Thermal Printer" exhibit low or negative profit margins. These products may benefit from cost management or price adjustments to enhance profitability.

* Urgent Actions Needed: Products with very low sales and high negative profits, including "Bush Westfield Collection Bookcases" and "GBC Plasticlear Binding Covers," require urgent review. Evaluating product positioning, marketing efforts, or considering discontinuation could help balance overall sales and profit performance.

</br>

***Discount impact analysis***

* Implementing a tiered discount strategy might work best. Offering lower discounts generally yields better profitability, but selectively applying higher discounts in specific scenarios (e.g., for strategic customer acquisition or clearing inventory) could balance volume and profit. Ensure that discount policies align with customer expectations and market trends to maintain competitiveness and customer satisfaction.

* To optimize profitability, consider adjusting discount strategies based on the region and category performance. Lower discounts, particularly in high-margin categories like Technology and Office Supplies, can improve profitability. Monitoring regional discount trends can help balance sales volume with profitability, ensuring that discount strategies align with financial goals and market competitiveness.

</br>

***Shipping mode analysis***

* Standard Class: This mode has the highest total orders and profitability across all segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) and regions (East, Central, South, West). It consistently performs well due to its balance of cost and delivery speed, making it the preferred choice for many customers. Standard Class also shows stable profitability across regions and segments, indicating widespread acceptance.

* Second Class: Although less popular than Standard Class, Second Class is still highly profitable with a moderate order volume. It performs well in terms of profitability across segments and regions, particularly in the Consumer and Corporate segments. This suggests that Second Class offers a good balance between cost and service, appealing to price-sensitive customers.

* First Class and Same Day: First Class and Same Day have lower order volumes compared to Standard Class but vary in profitability. Same Day has the lowest order count and profitability, indicating it‚Äôs used less frequently, possibly due to higher costs or limited demand.
